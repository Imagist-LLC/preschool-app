            <h2>Off to a beautiful start.</h2>
            <p>Good design matters—even for the youngest learners. <strong>Preschool.app</strong> is thoughtfully crafted with a clean interface, large buttons, and intuitive navigation that’s been battle-tested with real children. Every element—from layout to color—has a purpose: to highlight what matters and guide without overwhelming. No distractions. No gimmicks. Just pure learning.</p>

            <h2>Colors that pop. And slide.</h2>
            <p>Explore the rainbow in a way little fingers can’t resist. Slide through vibrant colors, tap to hear their names, and see each one brought to life through playful animations. It’s early color recognition made engaging, with interactions that are as intuitive as they are fun.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Shapes that stick.</h2>
            <p>Learning shapes has never been this fun. From circles and squares to stars, children can explore each shape, see real-world examples, and (coming soon) match outlines in an interactive puzzle. <strong>Preschool.app</strong> combines exploration and reinforcement for learning that lasts.</p>

            <h2>This app speaks to you. Not at you.</h2>
            <p>Introduce the alphabet through clear phonics and engaging visuals. Tap a letter, hear its sound, and see it in use. No noisy sound effects—just clear, confident pronunciation. Learning to read starts with listening—and <strong>Preschool.app</strong> makes it easy.</p>

            <h2>Designed to adapt.</h2>
