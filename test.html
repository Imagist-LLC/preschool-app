            <p>Explore the rainbow in a way little fingers can’t resist. Slide through vibrant colors, tap to hear their names, and see each one brought to life through playful animations. It’s early color recognition made engaging, with interactions that are as intuitive as they are fun.</p>

            <p>Learning shapes has never been this fun. From circles and squares to stars, children can explore each shape, see real-world examples, and (coming soon) match outlines in an interactive puzzle. <strong>Preschool.app</strong> combines exploration and reinforcement for learning that lasts.</p>
