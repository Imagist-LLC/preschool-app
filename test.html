        <h2 class="tagline">Off to a beautiful start.</h2>
        <p class="caption">Good design matters—even for the youngest learners. Preschool.app is thoughtfully crafted with a clean interface, large buttons, and intuitive navigation that’s been battle-tested with real children. Every element—from layout to color—has a purpose: to highlight what matters and guide without overwhelming. No distractions. No gimmicks. Just pure learning.</p>

            <h2>Colors that pop. And slide.</h2>
            <p>Explore the rainbow in a way little fingers can’t resist. Slide through vibrant colors, tap to hear their names, and see each one brought to life through playful animations. It’s early color recognition made engaging, with interactions that are as intuitive as they are fun.</p>
